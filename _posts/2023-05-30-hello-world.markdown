Hello, world.

Just like in programming languages, I start this blog as everything should start: Hello world. Here will be a place where I can post ideas or words I would like to keep.

Don't expect anything extraordinary here, just random ideas about any subject. No commitment and no specific theme.

Well, the first step I've taken. Now, what lies ahead?

Ah, I almost forgot, my name is Leandro, and I'm a Software Engineer. Nice to meet you.
